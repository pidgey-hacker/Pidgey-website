        If there is a single point of advice I can offer novice computer users, it is <em>stop using modern computers</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you look at "technology YouTube," but I more mean the massive multi-million subscriber channels, nearly all of it is devoted to constantly reviewing and comparing every new computer, processor, graphics card and product.
        There's big money in it because obviously all of these companies put money in it, but also if you're a normal person, you automatically assume you need the "best" technology.
        </p>

        <h2>Do you need a modern computer?</h2>

        <p>
        Absolutely not. More than 95% of people could be using a computer from 2008 or before without any problems.
        Needing a recent machine is limited to people who:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do extreme, professional, processor-intensive video-rendering.</li>
            <li>Compile massive programs and operating systems. (I'm not talking about your little <a href="https://suckless.org">suckless</a> programs.)</li>
            <li>Play recent triple AAA video-games on high settings.</li>
            <li>Use many massive Electron apps and other inexcusably bad software written by soydevs and other people who shouldn't be writing software.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The last two reasons aren't really real reasons at all because they are totally unnecessary and avoidable things.
        </p>

        <p>
        But to the point, watching YouTube videos and using a word processor does not require last month's new release.
        </p>
		
        <h3 class=margintop15>How much should a computer cost a normal person?</h3>

        <p>
        Either nothing or just around $200, I say.
        I was using a Toshiba Satellite C855D.
        you can laso get something like a ThinkPad X220 for $90.
        Like anything else, <strong>if you are buying things on Amazon, you're doing it wrong</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 class=mordencomputerline>The Downside of Modern Computers</h2>

        <h3>Modern computers are more breakable</h3>

        <p>
        As computing as become more and more popular, companies have started to realize that a consumer's first reaction on having their $5 wifi card die is immediately buy a whole new computer.
        This means two things: (1) they don't bother to make computers easy to repair, in fact, they make it more difficult for people to repair their computers
        (2) there is absolutely no need to make computers durable at all. In fact, it's probably better to let computers break so you'll get yet another sale.
        </p>

        <p>
        Apple is by far the most anti-social computing company because of this.
        I'll let the larger tech channels show you the specifics, but every Apple product is brilliantly designed to make it difficult to fix very basic and otherwise fixable problems.
        They have quite a racket licensing out the ability and tools to companies that want to fix their terrible hardware.
        Apple even used pentalobe screws just so normal people couldn't open their computers up with a typical screwdriver.
        Of course nowadays every other computer manufacturer imitates the Apple style where apparent "sleekness" is supposed to be a signal of high quality.
        </p>

        <h3 class=mordencomputerline>Modern computers are increasingly monitoring devices and come with proprietary junk.</h3>

        <h4>The Management Engine</h4>

        <p>
        You might've heard that all Intel i3/i5/i7 processors (that is, after the Intel Core 2 Duo) have an onboard alternate processor that is meant to function as spyware.
        This is called the Intel Management Engine.
        It can view your memory and connect to the internet: basically all modern computers have this permanent back door.
        In older computers, say the ThinkPad X200, you can, with a little hardware action, remove the other processor and replace with proprietary BIOS with <a href="https://libreboot.org">Libreboot</a> or <a href="https://coreboot.org">Coreboot</a>, but that is <em>not possible</em> on more modern computers (you can install Coreboot on a more modern machine, but not all of the components of the Management Engine are removed).
        </p>

        <p>
        More recent computers, however are non-removable spyware by design and, yes, the NSA can monitor any machine with a Management Engine.
        There are actually even rumors that one of the taps that the FBI under the Obama administration put on Trump during his campaign was a Management Engine bug.
        </p>

        <p>Note that AMD (Ryzen) processors have what they call a "Platform Security Processor" that is equivalent to the Intel Management Engine, so you're not escaping the issue by using one of them.
        </p>
		
        <h3>The Problem of Windows</h3>

        <p>
        How many times have you heard a normie explain to you that their computer is slow because it's "really old" and they bought it "way back in 2015?"
        It's an absurd statement of course.
        Computers don't just get magically slow...
        <strong>...unless they've been running Windows.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
        In the future, once even Microsoft has switched over to a purely Unix-based backend for their operating system,
        we're all going to have a good laugh about how Microsoft Windows, <em>literally the worst and least functioning operating system ever devised</em>,
        was the largest consumer market share for decades.
        </p>

        <p>
        I might go into how Windows is poorly designed in another page, but I want to be clear that there is no such loss of speed on any
        Linux distribution, which is what you should be using.
        <strong>Linux runs fast on old hardware</strong>.
       however, that I'm not <em>big</em> into "Linux Evangelism," mostly because it's sort of strident and doesn't really work with a high success rate.
        Using Linux is just something that normies have been immunized against (mostly because "It's what smart people do"), but I always find myself in a position where someone's Window installation has permanently crashed and they're at the awkward decision of having to <em>buy a license</em> to reinstall the dysfunctional and slow operating system they've grown to hate.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        There is quite literally no problem that normal people have with computers that is not immediately alleviated by installing Linux.
